the crossorigin attribute in a <script> tag is like a rule that tells your web browser how to behave when it's trying to load a script (a piece of code) from a different place on the internet.

Imagine you're building a website, and you want to use a cool script that's stored on another website. The crossorigin attribute helps in two scenarios:

No Credentials Needed (anonymous):

If the script is something that anyone can use, like a general tool, you can use crossorigin="anonymous". It means your browser will grab the script without telling the other website who you are. It's like saying, "I don't need to log in or prove who I am to use this script."
html
Copy code
<script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
Credentials Needed (use-credentials):

If the script is special and requires you to log in or prove who you are, you'd use crossorigin="use-credentials". This tells your browser, "Hey, I might need to show who I am to use this script, so be prepared to send my credentials."
html
Copy code
<script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="use-credentials"></script>
It's like having a key to a library. If the library (the server hosting the script) says, "Anyone can use these books (scripts)," you don't need to prove who you are (anonymous). But if the library says, "Only members with library cards (credentials) can take these special books (scripts)," then you say use-credentials.

So, the crossorigin attribute helps your browser play nice and follow the rules when getting code from other places on the web!

Routing
Routing is the mechanism by which requests are connected to some code. It is essentially the way you navigate through a website or web-application. By clicking on a link, the URL changes which provides the user with some new data or a new webpage.

Server-side
When browsing, the adjustment of a URL can make a lot of things happen. This will happen regularly by clicking on a link, which in turn will request a new page from the server. This is what we call a server-side route. A whole new document is served to the user.

A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether.

Pros
A server-side route will only request the data that’s needed. No more, no less.
Because server-side routing has been the standard for a long time, search engines are optimised for webpages that come from the server.
Cons
Every request results in a full-page refresh. That means that unnecessary data is being requested. A header and a footer of a webpage often stays the same. This isn’t something you would want to request from the server again.
It can take a while for the page to be rendered. However, this is only the case when the document to be rendered is very large or when you have slow internet speed.
Client-side
A client-side route happens when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page. When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented. The adjustment to the URL will result in a changed state of the application. The changed state will ultimately result in a different view of the webpage. This could be the rendering of a new component, or even a request to a server for some data that the application will turn into some HTML elements.

It is important to note that the whole page won’t refresh when using client-side routing. There are just some elements inside the application that will change.

Pros
Because less data is processed, routing between views is generally faster.
Smooth transitions and animations between views are easier to implement.
Cons
The whole website or web-application needs to be loaded on the first request. That’s why the initial loading time usually takes longer.
Because the whole website or web-application is loaded initially, there is a possibility that there is data downloaded for views you won’t even come across.
It requires more setup work or even a library. Because server-side is the standard, extra code must be written to make client-side routing possible.
Search engine crawling is less optimised. Google is making good progress on crawling single-paged-apps, but it isn’t nearly as efficient as server-side routed websites.
